# Multiplayer example in Unity using hydna

This Unity sample project uses hydna (www.hydna.com) to create a simple multiplayer demo which can be influenced from a html/javascript page **chicken-god-web/index.html**.

## Setup

If you like you can replace the hydna domain used here with your own (change **HYDNA_DOMAIN** in **Assets/ChickenGameController.cs**). If you decide to use your own domain don't forget to also upload the **behavior.js** file in your hydna control panel.

You can create a free hydna domain at https://www.hydna.com/

## Installation



## Usage

Open the **chicken-god-web/index.tml** file to see and control player states in the demo.
