# Multiplayer example in Unity using hydna

![game and web controller](/screenshots/screen.jpg)

This Unity sample project uses hydna ([www.hydna.com](https://www.hydna.com/)) to create a simple multiplayer demo which can be influenced from a html/javascript page **chicken-god-web/index.html**.

## Setup

If you like you can replace the hydna domain used here with your own (change **HYDNA_DOMAIN** in **Assets/ChickenGameController.cs**). If you decide to use your own domain don't forget to also upload the **behavior.js** file in your hydna domain control panel.

You can create a free hydna domain at [www.hydna.com](https://www.hydna.com/)

## Installation

Open the **Assets/ChickenHydnaDemo.unity** file and build the project for MacOSX, Windows or linux.

## Usage

Open the **chicken-god-web/index.tml** file to see and control player states in the demo.

Then run you compiled app on you selected platform and have a friend or more do the same.

## License etc

No animals were harmed in the making of this demo, but the animal assets can only be used to try out the demo project. If you want to use the animals in your own project they can be found in the unity asset store:

[chicken](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/5029) or the 
[fox](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/14260)
